# Dashboard Service

The goal of this micro service is to facilitate the creation of Dashboards for a frontend application

This tool is heavily inspired by cube.dev

The idea is that with one request you should be able to compile data in your database. The request is human readable and the SQL / MongoDB request is generated at runtime by the tool.

The tool has a focus on generating MongoDB requests at runtime depending on different inputs that you put in your request.
